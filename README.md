Default Detection of Credit Card Clients

Problem

Credit card users can sometimes default on payments. In order to reduce the risk of defaults, banks and credit institutions use credit-risk evaluation to determine which clients will default; so they can limit their credit limits accordingly to minimize financial loss. 

Approach and Data

I propose to utilize a neural network classifier to predict which credit card users will default on their payments in the next month. The data is provided by I-Cheng Yeh of Chung Hua University and Che-hui Lien of Tamkang University in Taiwan. Which can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients

Methodology

1. First, I will separate the data into training and testing sets (either 70/30 or 60/40).
2. I will train the neural network classifier model with training set.
3. I will then use the testing set to test the predictive capability of the model and report on the accuracy.
4. I will utilize R to build the neural network classifier model.
